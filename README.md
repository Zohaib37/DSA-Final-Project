## Brief
The user has two options, either compress or decompress a file. If the user clicks on compress button, a file dialog opens that allows the user to input a text file for compression. Compression algorithm is applied on the file and a compressed version is created on the user’s computer. If the user clicks on decompress button, file dialog opens again and the user can input the compressed version of the file. Decompression algorithm is applied and a new file, with original contents restored, is saved on the user’s computer. In order to run this code, a text file is necessary. The user can either input a text file from their machine, or use the example text file provided in the repository.
